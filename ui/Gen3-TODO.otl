[_] 20% Gen 3 current todo
	[_] 40% High priority
		[_] ASAP: support relative paths in cache...
		[_] ASAP: load/view un-cached directories...
		[_] ASAP: rotate images in the viewer...
		| This is a tad complicated by:
		| 	- marks
		| 	- image elem proportions that can change
		[_] ASAP: import fav dirs...
		[_] BUG: sometimes duplicate images get loaded...
		| this happens when jumping back and forth on the mid ribbon until
		| the last element shows up and then moving left until the frame
		| around the image disappears...
		| at this point, this will return 2:
		|
		| 	$('[order='+$('.current.image').attr('order')+']').length
		|
		[_] BUG: jumping screen images does not load the adjacent ribbons...
		| positioning is OK but ribbons are not fully visible...

			[_] group
			| a group should behave as a single image but is 
			| viewable/expandable as a ribbon...
			|
			| should be two types of groups:
			| 	- strict - always as a single image
			| 		like a set of versions, processed and processing 
			| 		versions of the same image.
			| 		(auto-group?)
			| 	- loose - similar images, could be named collections
			| 		viewed individually, but can be accessed either from 
			| 		a list or a member image (primary).
			[_] collection
			| make or add to existing collection
		[_] 50% Undo/Redo

		| exactly the same result...
		[X] ASAP: rewrite binSearch!! 
		| linSearch obviously is not usable for large sets of data...
		[X] split saving/loading into files and localStorage
		| DATA
		| 	- stored in localStorage
