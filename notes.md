About a year ago the project reached a stable state for most of my use-cases
this development stagnated a bit and went into "if something goes wrong 
write it down and continue on" mode. 
During this period the we've accumulated:
	- quite a list of known bugs
	- quite a backlog of breaking updates of upstream software (electron)

In addition to this and a couple of other events I had trouble finding 
motivation to dig in.

It is about time to schedule a big revision run to fix the accumulated 
set of issues and implement several planned features.
